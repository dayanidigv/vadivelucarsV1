## 💡 RECOMMENDATION

**Current Status**: Foundation is solid, but key features missing for the target user (dad).

**Next Action**: Focus on **Phase 1** items first - these are critical for the target user experience and business value.

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks to complete all pending items for full production readiness.

**Risk**: Without voice search and offline support, the system may not meet the core requirement of "dad can use it easily in the shop environment."
